<h1 className="font-medium text-lg pt-12">Tristan Deane</h1>

I'm a software engineer, hacker, and, most recently, a [proud dad](/posts/proud-dad), currently slinging code at [Nimble](/work) to help schools find outstanding educators.

Programming and tech may have come later in life, but they quickly became a passion. I believe the future belongs to the builders, and the internet is the most powerful form of leverage for creating an impact. This notion spurs my daily routine of [coding](https://github.com/software-trizzey) and making projects.

I like books on entrepreneurship and philosophy, swinging kettlebells, and holding the controversial belief that <em>Star Wars: Episode III</em> is the best in the series.
