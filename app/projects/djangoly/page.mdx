## What is Djangoly?

Djangoly is an IDE extension I built to help development teams maintain high-quality Django codebases. It automates the enforcement of Django best practices, runs security checks, and ensures consistent code conventions across projects.

## Why Build It?

While working on large Django applications, I noticed our team spending significant time on code reviews catching the same issues:
- Inconsistent variable names and project structure
- Missing security configurations
- Non-optimal database queries
- Overlooked Django-specific best practices

Rather than repeatedly documenting these issues, I created Djangoly to automate these checks and provide immediate feedback to developers.

## Key Features

- **Automated Linting**: Custom Django-specific linting rules
- **Security Scanning**: Checks for common Django security misconfigurations
- **Performance Analysis**: Identifies potential database query optimizations
- **Convention Enforcement**: Ensures consistent project structure and naming
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with popular CI/CD pipelines

## Supported IDEs

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

## Impact

While still in beta,Djangoly has significantly reduced our code review cycles and helped maintain consistent quality across our Django projects. It serves as both a learning tool for junior developers and a safety net for experienced ones.
