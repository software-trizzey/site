## What is Project Teapot?

Project Teapot is a playful, interactive resume scanner experience inspired by [shop.merchant.dev](https://shop.merchant.dev/). I built it out of curiosity after seeing the site make the rounds on X and realizing there was no public repository to learn from.

That sent me down a reverse-engineering rabbit hole of browser source inspection and network request analysis, followed by rebuilding the experience in my own style.

## Why Build It?

I wanted to sharpen my ability to break down polished frontend experiences and reproduce them from observation, then push the concept further with my own UX ideas.

The hard parts were mostly animation workflow and compositing:

- Generated clips were inconsistent across tools and prompts
- I had to solve aspect ratio and framing mismatches to blend clips over a static background
- I wrote an `ffmpeg` bash script to normalize renders into a consistent format
- I started with RunwayML, then switched to Veo 3.1 via the Gemini API, which produced much better first-pass results

## Core UX Loop

1. Visitor enters the scene
2. Robot greets them
3. Visitor explores hotspots
4. Resume scanner draws attention
5. Visitor uploads a resume or picks a sample
6. Scan runs and returns feedback with humor + insights
7. Visitor shares or tries another resume

## Resume Scan Flow

- User clicks **Scan Resume**
- Modal asks them to choose **Upload Resume** or **Use Sample Resume**
- Upload path shows a disclosure that a third-party platform is used for analysis and no resume/result data is stored by the app after upload
- User must explicitly agree before continuing to `.pdf`/`.docx` upload (including drag-and-drop on desktop)
- If they do not agree, they can continue with themed sample resumes backed by JSON
- After either path is selected, scan animation plays and results are displayed in a dialog

## What's Next

Project Teapot is development-complete at this point. I set out to recreate and extend the experience I had in mind, and this version delivers on that initial vision.
