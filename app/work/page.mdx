# Work

<AnimatedName />


On a mission to build products with awesome people. Here's a summary of my work so far.

## Nimble Hiring

<Small>Software Engineer, 2021 - Present</Small>

[Nimble](https://www.hirenimble.com/) is a modern SaaS platform that helps schools find amazing teachers. I joined as the fifth member of their small and mighty team because I believed that technology could be used to redefine the hiring process.

Throughout my time with them, I've had the opportunity to wear many hats and work on interesting and challenging problems. On the frontend, I led the successful transition to TypeScript within the team, significantly improving the reliability of our code. Django powers our backend, and I've worked to become our team's go-to expert. This includes developing Djangoly, an open-source tool designed to help our team follow Django's best practices and leverage the framework to its full potential.

When I'm not actively developing, you can find me regaling newer team members (there are 25 of us now!) with stories from the early startup days or running interviews to ensure our squad's culture remains impeccable.

## TCA Developments

<Small>Full Stack Developer, 2020 - 2021</Small>

[TCA Developments](https://www.tcadevelopments.com/) is a General Contractor headquartered in my hometown of Edmonton, Alberta. We initially connected through a one-off contract after I offered to redesign their company website, which was still using an HTML table as the layout for the homepage. They were so impressed with the final product that they extended a permanent position, inviting me to help modernize other areas of their company.

During my time there, I independently developed and implemented an inventory and checkout system to address property theft, combining a robust Django backend with a sleek Next.js client for seamless operation. The system utilized JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure communication, ensuring the integrity of user data across frameworks. This solution led to an impressive 81% reduction in property theft, directly benefiting the company's bottom line.
